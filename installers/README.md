# Installing Elm

There are two ways to install Elm:

- **Installers** for Mac or Windows
- **Instructions** for [Mac][mac] or [Linux][lin]

The code in this directory builds the Mac and Windows installers, which are available [here](https://guide.elm-lang.org/install.html).

It is definitely valuable to read the install instructions even if you are not using them though! They reveal how installers actually work.

[lin]: https://github.com/elm/compiler/blob/master/installers/linux/README.md

## Installing Multiple Versions

The secret is that Elm is just a single executable file. If you are developing a project in `~/Desktop/project/` you can download this file into that directory and run commands like `~/Desktop/project/elm make src/Main.elm` or `./elm make src/Main.elm`. You just run the local copy of the executable file!

The instructions for [Mac][mac] and [Linux][lin] explain how to do this in more detail. You can follow the same steps on Windows, but you need to do each step by hand. (E.g. download the file through your browser rather than with a terminal command.)
